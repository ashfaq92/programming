Functions:
    Functions allow you to turn big problems into small problems, which become much easier to solve.
    Functions provide a mechanism to separate script tasks and then complete them with reusable chunks of code.
    Functions serve as a great way to eliminate duplicate code since the code in a function can be reused as many times as you want.
    Arguments allow you to pass data into functions as input for a given task.
